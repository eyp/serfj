SerfJ - Simplest Ever REST Framework for Java
=============================================

### Since nowadays there's no meaning for a framework like this, the project is discontinued.

Using SerfJ is the easiest way of developing Java [REST] web applications. It helps
you develop your application over an elegant MVC arquitecture, giving more importance
to convention than configuration, so for example, you will not have to have configuration 
files or annotations in order to specify which view serves a controller's method. However, 
SerfJ is a very flexible library, so if you want to jump over those conventions, you can 
configure the behaviour of your applications as you like.

The framework tries to meet [JSR-311] specification, but it doesn't follow every point 
of that, because the purpose is to have a very intuitive library, and some some aspects 
of the specification are out of the scope of SerfJ.
